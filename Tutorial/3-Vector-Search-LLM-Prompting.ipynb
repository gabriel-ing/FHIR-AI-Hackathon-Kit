In these cases it is possible to download a local version of models. Local versions can be downloaded with Ollama, or very simply with hugging faces. \n",

    "### Adding Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "When we chat with a chatbot, it's ideal for the model to remember the conversation that has come before. Memory can be implemented by passing the previous messages back to the chatbot with our next queries. Instead though, we going to use [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) to automate this. \n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain cane automatically create summaries of the conversations rather than passing the whole message into the chatbot, reducing the length of the prompt to the model. This reduction can speed up the response, and reduce the amount of tokens used (and with API chatbot access, you pay per token). It is common to use a small model as a summariser, with a larger, better model for creating the actual response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to install langchain and langchain community with pip. Uncomment and run the following:"

      "\n",
      "**Important Note:**  While the data doesn’t explicitly state a respiratory history, it’s crucial to consider that viral sinusitis can, in rare cases, be associated with underlying conditions like immune-mediated sinusitis that *could* involve inflammation and potential respiratory involvement.  However, the current data doesn't indicate a need for further investigation in that area.\n",

      "*   **Reported Fatigue:** Alisia *does* report fatigue, specifically mentioning it in her clinical summary. The severity is described as “mild,” which is important – it’s not a debilitating level.\n",
      "*   **Timing:** The fatigue is *likely* age-related, a crucial piece of information.  It’s consistent with typical fatigue experienced as individuals age.\n",
      "*   **Associated Symptoms:** Her history of “mild joint stiffness in the mornings” adds a layer of potential concern. While joint stiffness itself isn't directly linked to fatigue, it *could* be a symptom of underlying musculoskeletal issues (like postural strain or inflammation), which *could* contribute to fatigue.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Other Symptoms:** The fact that she doesn't report any acute illness makes it harder to immediately rule out a specific underlying cause of fatigue. This allows for a broader exploration.\n",
      "*   **Vitals & Bloodwork:** Her Hemoglobin A1c (6.35%) suggests a slightly elevated blood sugar, which is relevant given the context of fatigue and potential underlying conditions. It also indicates a need for continued monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Interpretation & Recommendations**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the context of her fatigue, here's a suggested approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Further Investigation:** It is appropriate to request a broader assessment.  Based on her fatigue, I would consider including a:\n",
      "    *   **Comprehensive Fatigue Questionnaire:** This would probe more deeply into the nature of her fatigue – how it impacts her daily life, activities, sleep, etc.\n",
      "    *   **Physical Exam:** A more thorough musculoskeletal examination could help identify any contributing factors.\n",
      "    *   **Repeat HbA1c:** Further monitoring of her glucose control is necessary, especially considering her history of diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Rule out underlying causes:** Fatigue is a common symptom of several conditions, including:\n",
      "   *   **Vitamin deficiencies**\n",
      "   *   **Thyroid issues**\n",
      "   *   **Sleep disturbances**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Conclusion:**  The reported fatigue is a key piece of the puzzle, and a more in-depth evaluation is warranted to determine if it's a purely age-related issue or indicative of a more complex situation.\n"

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are using synthetically generated clinical notes created by by a large language model. We have used a very small dataset, with only three patients with only 10 clinical notes each. However, it does show the potential of the process. You can hopefully see how this could be scaled up into a useful resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where to continue from here :\n",
    "\n",
    "If this were a real project, rather than a quick demo, a number of improvements could be made:\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Vector Search\n",
    "    - **Use a Medical Specific Embedding Model.** \n",
    "    - **Create a Score requirement**\n",
    "        - The relevance of a search result to the prompt can be seen by the vector-cosine with a number between 1 and -1. You can use this to create a minimum requirement to classify a result as a hit.\n",
    "    - **Filter by Date**\n",
    "        - We are querying a patients entire medical history, which means we could get results from 50 years ago which obscure results from 6 months ago due to a slightly better semantic match. In reality we would probably be more interested in recent results, even if they weren't quite as good a match as the older ones.\n",
    "        - We could approach this in different ways - we could just add a date restriction (e.g. search only in last 5 years) or we could take the top N results when ordered by score and then order them by date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### LLM prompting\n",
    "    - Use a better LLM\n",
    "    - Refine the system prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### General set-up or design:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Link source information**\n",
    "        - It is key that the medical practitioner sees the information that the LLM can see, because LLMs do have a habit of making things up... \n",
    "    - **Add a Front-end User Interface**\n",
    "    - **Create more detailed medical history using a range of resource types (e.g. Conditions, Immunizations, Observations, Medications and more)**\n",
    "    - **Improve Patient ID collection** - At the moment the method to give the Patient ID is very clunky and involves knowing the patient by their ID, not by any easily identifiable systems. This could be improved by adding a beginning form or interaction that asks for full name, address or DOB to identify the patient without needing to know the ID>\n",
    "    - **Using an Agentic method to add functionality to the chatbot** - You could look at LangChain or LangGraph documentation to have a better idea of this. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the final point, here I have used DocumentReference resources because this is one of the few plain text resources with clinically relevant notes. Even in this example, I had to generate the clinical notes myself using an LLM. A more complete example of this may involve creating plain-text strings of medical notes using other resources available. For example, you could group FHIR resources by year, take clinically relevant resources [ Condition, Observation, AllergyIntolerance, Procedures, Immunization, CarePlan], create strings representing the clinical information per year and use this for the vector search method we have implemented above. \n",
    "\n",
    "A nice example of a complete project with a similar set-up is available on the [Open Exchange](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/package/FHIR-Data-Explorer-with-Hybrid-Search-and-AI-Summaries-1) by Pietro Di Leo. There are some key differences from this demo, for example the tabular data is created within Python and directly loaded into a SQL database. \n",
