Patient Name: Clark Kent
DOB: [Redacted]
Date of Visit: 09/10/2025
Presenting Complaint:
Patient presents with complaints of persistent chest discomfort and intermittent episodes of spontaneous x-ray vision activation, particularly during emotionally charged situations (e.g., office meetings, romantic encounters, surprise birthday parties).
History of Present Illness:
Mr. Kent reports a recent increase in involuntary activation of his x-ray vision, resulting in several awkward social encounters, including accidentally seeing through three floors of the Daily Planet building. He also notes mild chest tightness after flying through a cumulonimbus cloud at Mach 3, which he describes as “like being hugged by a thunderstorm.”
Past Medical History:

Kryptonian physiology
Solar overexposure syndrome (resolved)
Mild allergic reaction to kryptonite (ongoing)

Medications:

None (immune to most Earth-based pharmaceuticals)

Allergies:

Kryptonite (severe photosensitivity, weakness, existential dread)

Physical Examination:

Vitals: Stable (heart rate 0 bpm, due to solar-powered circulatory system)
Chest: Steel-like thoracic wall, no tenderness
Eyes: Glowing intermittently, pupils reactive to red sun radiation
Neurological: Alert, oriented, capable of hearing distress calls from 3 galaxies away

Assessment:

Hyperactive X-Ray Vision Syndrome (HXVS) – Likely exacerbated by emotional stress and overexposure to yellow sun radiation.
Mild Thoracic Electromagnetic Burn – Secondary to high-speed atmospheric re-entry.

Plan:

Recommend temporary avoidance of high-emotion environments (e.g., Lois Lane’s apartment).
Prescribe lead-lined sunglasses for vision control.
Advise limiting solar charging to 2 hours/day.
Follow-up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms worsen or if another alien invasion occurs.

Physician:
Dr. Emil Hamilton, MD, PhD, S.T.A.R. Labs
