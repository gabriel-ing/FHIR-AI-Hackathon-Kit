# Using IRIS with Python for FHIR and AI applications

This repository contains tutorials for how to use InterSystems IRIS with an external Python Application to combine FHIR data with generative AI methods. 

## Contents 

This repo has 3 main sections: 
- **Demo**: contains several markdown and ipython notebook files which show how to set up a FHIR server, create SQL tables and implement a vector search in IRIS. It also contains a basic example of how this can be used to create a RAG chatbot. 
- **Additional Demos** - Some additional tutorials with other ways to use the IRIS FHIR server with Python. For example, it demonstrates a method to create new FHIR resources. These aren't used in the main tutorial sequence, but may be useful to your products.
- **Resources** - Some brief introductions that may be useful to get started quickly. These include: 
    - What is InterSystems IRIS
    - What is Results augmented generation (RAG)
    - What is FHIR
