FHIR is one of the most recent and widely adopted healthcare data standards. High level descriptions of FHIR are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but the key information to know is as follows: 

- FHIR resources are small packages of information which are useful to medical institutions.
- The purpose of a FHIR resource depends on resource type and can be further modulated by descriptions inside the resource.
- These are often accessed in JSON format.
- A FHIR server has separate endpoints for each resource type. These are REST API endpoints that can accessed through URLs.
